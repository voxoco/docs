# Invite a user to VOXO Mobile

If you are an account administrator you have the ability to invite your users to download and use the VOXO Mobile app for iOS/Android, Mac, and PC!

To get started, click on the extension of the person you'd like to send an invite to. Find the section called <strong>Web User Panel</strong> and click the <strong>Generate</strong> button next to the password field, fill in the email address, click the Send checkbox and scroll to the bottom and click Save.

The user will receive an invite via email with instructions for downloading and signing into the VOXO Mobile app!
