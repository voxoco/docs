# How To: Set Up Voicemail

Instructions for Voicemail Set-Up

To set up voicemail preferences start by pressing the “messages” button on your VOXO handset. Several options will be mentioned to you. You can press “0” to get to the greetings menu. You can record a full greeting or you can simply record your name with a generic greeting. 

You can always change your greeting by going back to “message” and following the audio prompts. 

Dialing *97 will also bring up these options.
