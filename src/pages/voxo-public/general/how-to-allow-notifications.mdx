# How to Allow Notifications
Enabling notifications on Window's 10

<strong>There are many causes for notifications to be blocked on a Window's 10 machine, to start let's make sure that your notifications are turned on in OMNIA. To do so follow the steps below</strong>

<ol>
    <li>
        First, click your profile in the top right corner of app.voxo.co and navigate to "Settings"
    </li>
    <li>
        Here you have three options below ( My Profile, My Devices, Preferences). We will go into Preferences and confirm Notifications are turned on (The green button to the right will indicate they are on).

    </li>
</ol>

<strong>After these settings are confirmed, we will check Google Chrome settings</strong>

<ol>
    <li>
        First select the three dots in the top right of your Google Chrome browser and select settings
    </li>
    <li>
        From here navigate to Privacy and Security on the left panel and then Site Settings
    </li>
    <li>
        Under Permissions you should see Notification settings. Select this and make sure app.voxo.co is under the list labeled "Allowed"
    </li>
    <li>
        You can select the site under this list for more detailed information on the site settings. Make sure Notifications are set to "Allow"

       <img src="/images/general/allow-notification/image 2.jpeg" alt="allow notification" />
    </li>
</ol>

<strong>If confirming the above settings still is not resulting in notifications, then Window's 10 is likely blocking them. The following steps will walk you through getting this resolved</strong>

Notifications & Actions

<ol>
    <li>
        First go to your Window's settings and select System
    </li>
    <li>
        On the left panel you will find Notifications & Actions
    </li>
    <li>
        This page will contain a list of applications and control whether or not they are allowed to send notifications. Towards the bottom you will find Google Chrome
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure Google Chrome is turned to "On" and select it for more detailed information on your notification settings
    </li>
</ol>

Focus Assist

<ol>
    <li>
        Navigate to your Window's settings and select System
    </li>
    <li>
        On the left panel you will find Focus Assist
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus Assist can block notifications, if you are still not receiving notifications make sure this setting is set to "Off"
    </li>
</ol>
