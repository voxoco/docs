Overview

This feature allows you to create custom drag and drop live stat dashboards for queues in your accounts. This feature can be found in Omnia at User Panel -> Call Queues -> Live Stats.

Each layout can include up to 15 queues at a time. By default, all stats include the totals for all selected queues in the dashboard. Each widget can be filtered to single or multiple queues.
