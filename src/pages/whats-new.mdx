# Attachments

Attachments are how you share things in Protocol â€” they allow you to send all sorts of files to your contacts and groups. On this page, we'll dive into the different attachment endpoints you can use to manage attachments programmatically. We'll look at how to query, upload, update, and delete attachments. {{ className: 'lead' }}
